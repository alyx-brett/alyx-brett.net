Dear John,

Since you're reading this, you have a care package from me, containing the following:

- A long package, which is a Secret Santa gift
- A rattly package
- Three other packages which form a coherent gift when combined

When you've opened all of your packages, click below to reveal extra details:

You mentioned that your keyboard's existing keycaps were weird, so I thought I'd get you some really high-quality ones! I'd love a before and after of your desk...

The three remaining packages are a glass syringe and some homemade coffee-infused whisky. I don't recommend drinking the whisky neat - if you taste some on your finger you'll find that it tastes like kissing a smoker. However, I have found it delicious as an ingredient: as a starting point you might consider [my best boulevardier](/blog/2020-12-23-My-Best-Boulevardier). I'd love to hear your ideas about how else to use it as well :)

I hope that your Christmas turns out well!

I love you lots
Alyx
