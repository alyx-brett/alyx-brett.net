Dear Mummy & Daddy,

Since you're reading this you've received a parcel from me!

It contains
- a large cylinder
- three small parcels which comprise a single gift

Once you've unwrapped, click below for an explanation!

I don't think I ever got to take you to Bar Termini, but they do make really excellent Negronis, which I thought might give you a little variety to try out!

The three remaining packages are a glass syringe and some homemade coffee-infused whisky. I don't recommend drinking the whisky neat - if you taste some on your finger you'll find that it tastes like kissing a smoker. However, I have found it delicious as an ingredient: as a starting point you might consider [my best boulevardier](/blog/2020-12-23-My-Best-Boulevardier). I'd love to hear your ideas about how else to use it as well :)

I hope you have a wonderful day!

All my love and best wishes,

Alyx
