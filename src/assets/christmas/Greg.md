Dear Greg, Aleks and Felicity,

Since you're reading this, you've received my parcel! Within it are the following parcels:

- Two soft packages, for Felicity
- A not-very-secret box wrapped in purple ribbon, for Aleks
- A very cuboidal box for Greg

...and three other items!

Once you've opened them, here's an explanation:

<div class="spoiler">
Felicity has 2 cloaks. The first one arrived 20cm shorter than I'd requested, so I got the maker to make a new one. I'm hoping that it's a garment that she can grow into over time, but also that it might give you outerwear for any more formal events that you might get to go to over the next couple of years... The outer is pure wool, and so should be at least somewhat dirt resistant and super warm (I wear mine in all weather). Please let me know how it fits and whether she likes it!

Greg - this watch winds itself; try swinging it back and forth a few times to get it started

Aleks - I tried to choose chocolates that were non-boozy and not-too-dark, and I hope I did ok.

The three remaining packages are a glass syringe and some homemade coffee-infused whisky. I don't recommend drinking the whisky neat - if you taste some on your finger you'll find that it tastes like kissing a smoker. However, I have found it delicious as an ingredient: as a starting point you might consider [my best boulevardier](/blog/2020-12-23-My-Best-Boulevardier). I'd love to hear your ideas about how else to use it as well :)

I hope you have a wonderful day!

All my love and best wishes,

Alyx
