Dear Brendan,

It was really lovely to see you the other day to give you your parcel!

It contains:
- A long thin package
- Three other packages which form a single gift

Once you've opened them, there's an explanation below:

The knife is the same knife I've been using for the last couple of years and I hope it'll fit your hand as well as it fits mine - if you have any fun culinary adventures enabled with them, please do share them with me!

The three remaining packages are a glass syringe and some homemade coffee-infused whisky. I don't recommend drinking the whisky neat - if you taste some on your finger you'll find that it tastes like kissing a smoker. However, I have found it delicious as an ingredient: as a starting point you might consider [my best boulevardier](/blog/2020-12-23-My-Best-Boulevardier). I'd love to hear your ideas about how else to use it as well :)

I hope that your Christmas is cozy and restful

I love you loads
