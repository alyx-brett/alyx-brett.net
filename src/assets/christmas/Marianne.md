Dear Marianne,

Since you're reading this, you wil have received a parcel from me! It contains:

- A soft package - which is a secret santa gift
- A long thin package, a very small round package, and a cylindrical package which form one gift
- Some other cuboidal packages

When you've opened them, click below for an explanation!

The leggings are from Girlfriend Collective which uses recycled plastic and seems legitimately like a good thing. Although I've never owned them they are well reviewed - I hope that you like them (and that they fit!)

The chocolate is a stocking filler...

The three remaining packages are a glass syringe and some homemade coffee-infused whisky. I don't recommend drinking the whisky neat - if you taste some on your finger you'll find that it tastes like kissing a smoker. However, I have found it delicious as an ingredient: as a starting point you might consider making [my best boulevardier](/blog/2020-12-23-My-Best-Boulevardier). I'd love to hear your ideas about how else to use it as well :)

I hope that you have a lovely weekend - please give them very warm wishes from me

I love you

Alyx
