I prefer a boulevardier to a negroni. While a chilled negroni is refreshing chilled in afternoon sunshine, I find that swapping the gin for rye in particular gives extra depth and interest, especially on winter afternoons or any time after sunset.

I also experimented a couple of years ago with cold-brew coffee; I find that the most delicious version to drink is a 1:10 coffee to water ratio steeped in the fridge for 12h before paper filtration. But since alcohol is a more powerful solvent than water, the question on my mind was what is the most powerful caffeinated beverage I can make? In the end I steeped 1:4 coffee to whisky (I used Wild Turkey rye) for 3 days, and the result was not only totally unpalatable but also absolute rocket fuel; a table-spoon kept me buzzing far past my bedtime. It has a smoky - almost ashy - taste, and an intense bitterness...

Given that I enjoy the extra oomph of a boulevardier over a negroni, I played with adding even more with my new ingredient, and I created the following recipe:

### Alyx's Best Boulevardier
(serves 2)

- 50g Rittenhouse Rye
- 50g Campari
- 50g Gonzalez Byass La Copa Vermouth
- 3.2ml coffee infusion

Preparation: Freeze a large ice block (I find that an individual christmas pudding pot works well)

1. Place the ice block in a measuring jug on some scales
2. Add the ingredients into the jug - use a pipette for the coffee infusion for better control
3. Stir a few times and serve
